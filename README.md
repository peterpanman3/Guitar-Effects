# Guitar-Effects
Guitar effects implemented in the Bela environment
This project was originally designed and implemented by Ryan Billing (found @ https://github.com/transmogrifox/transmogriFX_bela), I have made some simple changes to the render file and added a looper and volume pedal to the effects processor. Future plans include adding a few distortion models and an LCD display.
